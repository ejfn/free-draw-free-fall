# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/`: App source. Key files: `App.tsx` (UI + physics), `utils/geometry.ts` (shape recognition), `main.tsx`, styles (`App.css`, `index.css`).
- `public/`: Static assets served as-is.
- `dist/`: Build output (generated by Vite; do not edit).
- Root configs: `vite.config.ts` (base path for GH Pages), `eslint.config.js`, `tsconfig*.json`, `package.json`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm run dev`: Start Vite dev server with hot reload.
- `npm run build`: Production build to `dist/`.
- `npm run preview`: Serve the built app locally for verification.
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint on the project.
- `npm run deploy`: Publish `dist/` to GitHub Pages (`gh-pages` branch).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Language: TypeScript + React function components; hooks over classes.
- Indentation: 2 spaces; keep lines focused and readable.
- Filenames: Components `PascalCase.tsx` (e.g., `DrawingCanvas.tsx`); utilities `camelCase.ts` (e.g., `shapeUtils.ts`).
- Imports: Relative within `src/`; keep module boundaries simple (`src/utils/` for helpers).
- Linting: ESLint with TypeScript + React Hooks rules. Fix issues before committing (`npm run lint`).

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commits: Use Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`). Keep messages imperative and scoped (e.g., `feat: add circle fit quality check`).
- Branches: `feature/<short-name>`, `fix/<short-name>`.
- PRs: Include a clear description, screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and link related issues. Note any trade-offs.
- Checks before opening PR: `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, and manual `npm run preview` sanity check; ensure no console errors.

## Deployment Tips
- GH Pages: `vite.config.ts` sets `base: '/free-draw-free-fall/'`. Keep asset paths relative; run `npm run build && npm run deploy`.
- Do not commit `dist/`; the deploy script publishes it to the `gh-pages` branch.
